## Online Signature Verification
### Shivam Verma (2020CS50442)

The `sample/` directory contains 40 signature data of a person. 
The first 20 are genuine and rest 20 are forged ones.

`Signature Files → Data Reading → Feature Extraction → Template Creation → Verification`

### Run the code
1. `cd src/`

2. `python3 main.py`

### Matching Score
In the verification phase, if the dis-similarity score is less than 100, the signature is genuine otherwise it is fake.
